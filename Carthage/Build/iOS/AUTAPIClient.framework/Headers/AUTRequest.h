/// `AUTRequest` encapsulates data associated with making a request against the
/// Automatic API that cannot be expressed with NSURLRequest, such as what class
/// if any should be used when parsing the results.
///
/// In the future this may be extended with other things, such as treating 404
/// status codes as empty responses instead of errors.
///
/// To facilitate building requests, it uses the builder pattern, e.g.:
///
///     [[[AUTRequest
///         GET:@"/path/resource/%@", someID]
///         parameters:@{
///             @foo": @123
///         }]
///         resultClass:nil];
